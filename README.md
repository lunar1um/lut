# lut (dotone)
a horrible and broken mini git clone i made in rust  
in order to learn how git works under the hood!  

this is one of my mini projects to figure out new and *exciting* concepts,  
this is the first one, so i call it *dotone*, the next ones will be dottwo, dotthree, and so on.  

**why lut?**  
i dont really know, i just take my name (lunar) and (git) and mash them together  
actually, now that i think about it, lunit is somewhat a better-looking name
